## Instructions

### Step 1: Activate Yeast
Whisk yeast, honey, and 2½ cups lukewarm water in a medium bowl. Let sit 5 minutes until foamy or creamy.

### Step 2: Mix Dough
Add flour and salt. Mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms with no dry streaks.

### Step 3: First Rise
Pour 4 Tbsp. olive oil into a large bowl. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover and chill until doubled in size, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. (Or let rise at room temperature until doubled, 3-4 hours.)

### Step 4: Shape and Second Rise
Generously butter a 13×9" baking pan or 18×13" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. olive oil into center of pan. Using a fork in each hand, gather edges of dough and lift up and over into center of bowl. Rotate bowl a quarter turn and repeat 2 more times to form a rough ball. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour remaining oil from bowl over dough and turn to coat. Let rise uncovered in a warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1½ hours and up to 4 hours.

### Step 5: Bake
Place rack in middle of oven and preheat to 450°. Test dough by poking with your finger—it should spring back slowly, leaving a small indentation. Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch dough to fill pan. Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, creating deep depressions that reach the bottom of the pan. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake until puffed and golden brown all over, 20-30 minutes.

### Step 6: Garlic Butter
Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Peel and grate in 2-4 garlic cloves with a Microplane. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, 30-45 seconds.

### Step 7: Finish
Brush garlic butter all over focaccia. Slice into squares or rectangles.

## Notes

- **Storage:** Best eaten the day it's made. Freeze sliced pieces in a freezer-safe container and reheat on a baking sheet in a 300° oven.
- **Pan Size:** Use 13×9" for thicker focaccia (great for sandwiches) or 18×13" for thinner, crispier focaccia (great for snacking).
- **Raw Garlic Option:** Grate garlic into hot butter off heat, then brush immediately for raw garlic flavor.
