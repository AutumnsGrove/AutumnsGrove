# Hey Ariana

You found this.

I built this museum because you said you wanted to learn how to make your own website. And I realized—I have this whole codebase sitting here, full of patterns I figured out through late nights and stubborn curiosity. Why not turn it into something you can actually learn from?

But here's the thing I want you to know:

**You don't need to understand all of this to start.**

I didn't know any of this when I began. I just... started. Made ugly things. Broke stuff. Googled error messages at 2am. And slowly, piece by piece, it started making sense.

You're going to look at some of this code and think "I could never write this."

You're wrong.

You absolutely can. Not today, maybe. But sooner than you think. The gap between "I don't understand this" and "I built this" is smaller than it feels. It's just repetition and curiosity and refusing to give up when something doesn't work the first time.

You're signup #1 for a reason. I saw something in you—the same thing I see in myself. Someone who wants to build things that matter. Someone who isn't satisfied just consuming the internet, but wants to *make* it.

So go make it.

Start messy. Ship ugly. Learn as you go.

And when you get stuck, you know where to find me.

*P.S. — Your website doesn't have to look like mine. It should look like YOU. That's the whole point.*
