# Daily Summary - November 26, 2025

## What We Accomplished

Today was a highly productive development session with **42 commits across 5 repositories** focused on infrastructure migration, feature development, and ecosystem expansion. The crown jewel was successfully **migrating the AutumnsGrove blog system from file-based Vite glob to Cloudflare D1 database**, involving Worker deployment, schema application, Buffer polyfill fixes, and type compatibility resolution. We launched a **full-width gallery feature** with mood board layout, infinite scroll, and lightbox zoom functionality, then streamlined the home page by removing duplicate galleries. The **grove.place infrastructure** came to life with a complete landing page deployment featuring email signup, SEO optimization, duplicate signup handling, and CI/CD pipeline verification, while migrating email services across ProjectReminder, AutumnsGrove, and internal tooling.

The **GroveEngine project** received substantial documentation updates with npm package architecture specs, extraction/implementation/refactor prompts, and deployment workflow verification. **CDNUploader** was prepped for public release with comprehensive setup wizards, credential documentation, and generic examples replacing hardcoded domains. An unexpected but productive side quest involved **epub2tts**, where we resolved a critical 20-second audio generation issue through marker preprocessing fixes. The evening concluded with **admin panel refinements** including CSS variable standardization for border-radius consistency, 6-way image sorting (by date, name, and size), and five iterative commits to achieve perfect sidebar positioning with rounded corners that sit cleanly below the header without overlapping the footer—complete with user email display and logout functionality.

**Key Stats:** 27 commits to AutumnsGrove | 11 to GroveEngine | 2 to CDNUploader | 1 to ProjectReminder | 1 to epub2tts | 5 active repositories | ~12 hours across multiple time zones | Major milestones: D1 integration, grove.place launch, gallery feature, admin panel perfection | Infrastructure: Cloudflare Workers, D1 database, Resend email migration, CI/CD pipelines
