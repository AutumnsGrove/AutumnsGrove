Hello claude!!

Ok first things first. This dashboard is _awesome_. I love being able to visualize this stuff. Thank you. Secondly. Lets get into the feedback.

- The First box, with my name etc is HUGE. that needs to be, like, an eigth of the size. 
- Lets use 12h time for the When do I Code graph, but keep it the same way. just add am/pm markets with 12h time numbers.
- The Top Repositories overview is... bland. Maybe we put a brief description of the project in there too? Like, one sentence. 
- there needs to be a link to the source code for this website SOMEWHERE. and I think it should be here. Also make sure to callout that we are using Claude to analyze this stuff. Lets also REMOVE teh refresh button. This is publicly facing and I dont want abuse on my API key.
- The recent commits needs to be a box with its own content box within it, if that makes sense. It needs to only be about 2-3 commits "tall" but should be scrollable to show ALL of the recent ones. Allow for more text within each too and include which project its for in italics next to my username
