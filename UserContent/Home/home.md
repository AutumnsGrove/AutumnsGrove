## A Place to Be

This is my personal grove—a space for sharing thoughts, projects, and the occasional recipe. No algorithms. No engagement metrics. Just a place where ideas can grow at their own pace.

## What's Growing Here

- **Blog** - Thoughts on code, creativity, and life
- **Recipes** - Food is love made tangible
- **Gallery** - Visual snapshots and collections
- **[The Workshop](https://grove.place/roadmap/workshop)** - The larger ecosystem I'm building

*Pull up a chair. Stay a while.*
