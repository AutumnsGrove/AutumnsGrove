Hello friends!!

Apologies in the delays on posting. Been very busy working in the backend! If you joined the site a few days ago, please feel free to explore - everything should be functional. If not, feel free to reach out to me on my Contact page!

So. This new project!

# Grove - a place to Be You
So, as I've developed this current blog and learned all of the inner workings of SvelteKit and how Cloudflare works, I've tried various services and stumbled across subdomains. Subdomains are Awesome. right now, I have two subdomains on this page - `cdn.autumnsgrove.com` and `reminders.autumnsgrove.com`, which is for another [project](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/ProjectReminder). Then, that gave me an idea. What if I offer subdomains for all my friends and _their_ own blogs?

SO, I present to you, `grove.place`. 

While its not setup yet - the domain returns nothing - progress will be happening over the coming days and weeks. I've got the basic foundation for a blog website, so, I need to transfer _my_ code from this projects [repository](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/AutumnsGrove) and transfer it to the GroveEngine [repository](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/GroveEngine).

What will follow is a service where, for a small fee, users can create their _own_ grove. For the current vision that means a blog. Stay posted for more!
