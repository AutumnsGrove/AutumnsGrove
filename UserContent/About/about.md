## Hey, I'm Autumn

This is my little grove on the internet—a quiet space where I plant thoughts and watch them grow. Not for algorithms. Not for metrics. Just for the quiet joy of making something that feels like home.

I write code, cook elaborate meals, and believe the web should still have spaces that feel personal and warm. The kind of place where conversations happen in the margins of borrowed books, where the tea is always steeping, and where you don't have to perform for anyone.

## Why I Built This

Remember when the internet felt personal? When you had your little corner of it. When you weren't performing for an algorithm.

I got tired of watching friends get trapped in dopamine slot machines designed to exploit neurodivergent minds. I got tired of platforms that treat your words as training data. So I started building differently.

This site—and the [larger Grove ecosystem](https://grove.place) I'm creating—is my attempt to carve out something better. A forest of voices where people can just... write. Exist. Be.

AutumnsGrove is the personal tree in that forest. The one I tend myself.

## What You'll Find Here

### Blog Posts

Thoughts on technology, programming, and life. Sometimes technical, sometimes introspective, always honest. I write because processing in public helps me think, and maybe it'll help someone else too.

### Recipes

Food is love made tangible. I've collected recipes I actually cook—from weeknight dinners to elaborate projects. Everything tested, everything real.

### The Bigger Picture

I'm building [Grove](https://grove.place)—a platform for writers who want a home on the internet without the surveillance. If you want to see what's in the workshop, there's a [whole ecosystem of tools](https://grove.place/roadmap/workshop) being crafted: Ivy for privacy-first email, Meadow for community, Forage for domain discovery, and about two dozen more.

Check out the [GitHub Dashboard](/dashboard) to see what I've been working on lately.
