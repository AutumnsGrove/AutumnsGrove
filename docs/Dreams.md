### Focus
Hello friends, this document will be a bit more personal than the rest within this project. I want to describe today what my *dreams* are for this website.

For one, I _Dream_ of this website being an ideal version that can be easily recplicated as a template, so other people can plant their _own_ groves. I want to show people how easy it is to set up their _own_ blog, and, also, I want to demonstrate _why_ you should have a blog.

For now, this blog will be my own. I've heard I live in a sort of _peciliar_ way, so, I hope to share some of that here. Come join me!
