# TODOs for AutumnsGrove

> **Last Updated:** December 8, 2025 - GroveAuth integration complete

---

## ✅ COMPLETE: GroveAuth Integration

**Status:** GroveAuth centralized authentication is now integrated!

**What Changed:**
- Upgraded GroveEngine from 0.4.12 to 0.5.0
- Replaced local magic-code auth with GroveAuth OAuth2/PKCE flow
- Users now authenticate via `auth.grove.place` (Google, GitHub, or Magic Code)
- Tokens: access_token (1hr) + refresh_token (30d) with auto-refresh

**New Files:**
- `src/lib/auth/groveauth.ts` - Auth utility library
- `src/routes/auth/login/+server.ts` - Redirects to GroveAuth
- `src/routes/auth/callback/+server.ts` - Handles OAuth callback

**Deleted Files:**
- `src/routes/auth/login/+page.svelte` - Old magic code UI
- `src/routes/auth/send-code/+server.js` - Old code generation
- `src/routes/auth/verify-code/+server.js` - Old code verification

**Deployment Requirements:**
```bash
wrangler secret put GROVEAUTH_CLIENT_ID     # 'autumnsgrove'
wrangler secret put GROVEAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET # from GroveAuth
wrangler secret put GROVEAUTH_REDIRECT_URI  # https://autumnsgrove.com/auth/callback
```

## 🔲 Remaining Active Tasks

### Deploy Pending
- [ ] Deploy worker with `wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- [ ] Set GroveAuth secrets (see above)

- [ ] Task C: Paginate to fetch all repos using GraphQL cursor pagination
- [ ] Project comparison charts (bar chart, radar/spider, activity timeline)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements for charts
- [ ] Loading states and animations
- [ ] Lazy-load Chart.js (reduce initial bundle)
- [ ] Add error boundaries for graceful failures
