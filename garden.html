            This garden is a reflection of where I am right now, in this moment. Some things here will grow into full projects. Some will wilt and make space for new growth. Some will lay dormant until the season is right.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like any living garden, it requires tending. I revisit these sections regularly, updating what's changing, what's new, and what's fading. It's a way of being honest about where my energy goes and what matters most to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            If something here resonates with you, or if you'd like to collaborate on any of these thoughts or projects, please reach out. I believe in the power of shared tending.
