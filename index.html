        <h2>About</h2>

        <article class="about-content">
          <p>
            I'm a trans woman and queer-friendly technologist who believes the most profound moments often hide in plain sight—in the steam rising from a cup of tea, in the quiet hum of a well-built system, in the space between one thought and another. I observe life the way some people observe constellations: looking for patterns, meaning, and beauty where others might see only mundane details.
          </p>

          <p>
            By nature, I'm drawn to systems—both natural and digital. There's something deeply satisfying about understanding how things work, from the intricate web of an ecosystem to the elegant architecture of a Rust program. I believe technology should serve life, not diminish it. That's what solarpunk means to me: hopeful, rooted in nature, and designed for human flourishing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I find myself perpetually caught between two worlds—the tangible and the digital, the practical and the dreamlike. Like characters in a Murakami novel, I navigate the spaces between these realms, searching for small miracles and opportunities to build something meaningful. My greatest wish is to create spaces where people can truly connect, reflect, and be themselves.

            <h3>Systems & Languages</h3>
            <p>
              Diving deep into Rust and exploring the frontiers of systems programming. I'm fascinated by how low-level thinking can create elegant solutions. Currently exploring MCP servers and the beautiful intersection of control and abstraction.

            <h3>WebAssembly Adventures</h3>
            <p>
              Building bridges between server-side power and client-side possibility. WebAssembly represents a kind of digital solarpunk to me—efficient, purposeful, opening new possibilities without waste.

            <h3>Functional-OOP Hybrid Thinking</h3>
            <p>
              Exploring the space where functional and object-oriented paradigms meet. Finding balance in programming philosophy mirrors finding balance in life—sometimes you need structure, sometimes you need flow.

        <article class="dream-content">
          <p>
            Imagine a space where the mundane becomes sacred. A tea café and bookstore where people can unfold themselves over a cup of something warm and healing. Not a trendy third place, but a real one—where the late-night community gathers to read, write, talk, think, and simply exist together.
          </p>

          <p>
            I dream of shelves lined with the kind of books that change how you see the world. A carefully curated tea selection that heals more than just the body. A counter where conversations bloom unexpectedly. A space that says: <em>you belong here, exactly as you are.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This dream isn't just about tea and books. It's about creating infrastructure for connection and reflection in a world that often feels too fast, too loud, too isolated. It's a solarpunk vision made manifest—technology and nature and community, all in service of something beautiful and true.
