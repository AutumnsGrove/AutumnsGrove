Hello friends! ^-^

I hope everyone is doing well. I recently started this website, and need to outline what I will be posting on here. If you aren't interested in any of the topics - that's okay! Email me (autumnbrown23@pm.me) with whatever you want to discuss.

- Blog Posts
	- Technical findings
	- Interesting research
	- Life updates
	- Adventure logs
- Recipes
	- A collection of my personal recipe list.
	- Many of these recipes aren't originally mind. Proper credits will always be included.
- Developer demos
	- Not sure what this will be yet!
	- For inspiration - check out github.com/AutumnsGrove

Maybe I will start a newsletter. Maybe I will do interviews! I am really not sure. I've never owned a domain, even though my passion for technology has been intense for well over a decade. I hope you enjoy reading whatever I end up posting :)

Be well,
Autumn
