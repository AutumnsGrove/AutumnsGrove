# Welcome to AutumnsGrove

This is the inaugural post of my new blog! I'm excited to have a space to share my thoughts, projects, and ideas with the world.

## What is AutumnsGrove?

AutumnsGrove is my personal corner of the internet where I'll be:

- Sharing technical articles and tutorials
- Documenting my projects and learning journey
- Writing about topics that interest me
- Exploring new ideas and technologies

## What to Expect

I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:

1. **Web Development** - Tips, tricks, and tutorials
2. **Personal Projects** - Showcasing what I'm building
3. **Thoughts & Ideas** - Musings on technology and life
4. **Learning in Public** - Sharing my learning journey

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **SvelteKit** - A modern web framework
- **Markdown** - For writing posts
- **Cloudflare Pages** - For deployment

I chose this stack because it's fast, simple, and gives me full control over my content. No complex CMS, just markdown files and code.

## Stay Tuned

I'm looking forward to sharing more content here. Check back regularly for new posts, or subscribe to the RSS feed (coming soon!).

Thanks for visiting!
